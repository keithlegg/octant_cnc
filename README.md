THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT USE IT TO RUN A DANGEROUS MACHINE.

Any machinery capable of harming persons must have
provisions for completely removing power from all
motors, etc., before persons enter any danger area.

All machinery must be designed to comply with local 
and national safety codes, and the authors of this 
software cannot and do not, take any responsibility 
for such compliance.

What is it? Its 7 years of my own hobby programming - in a stack of libraries.


This is my attempt to make an open source CNC controller using a bunch of graphics code I wrote for fun. 


Contains a combination of older tools I built: 


This tool for a simple OpenGL GUI and 3D math libraries:
https://github.com/keithlegg/gnolmec


This tool for 3D spatial motion control: 
https://github.com/keithlegg/micro_cnc_controller


Together they may be able to be usable to control a 3D printer, CNC machine, Pick and place and more. 

We will see. 

More coming soon.
