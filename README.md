# Octant CNC 

(formerly confusion 36d)

THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. Not ready to run anything yet. Soon, hopefully.

Any machinery capable of harming persons must have
provisions for completely removing power from all
motors, etc., before persons enter any danger area.

All machinery must be designed to comply with local 
and national safety codes, and the authors of this 
software cannot and do not, take any responsibility 
for such compliance.

A brief history. 

<b>2018:</b>

It started out as a python program to visualize 3D vectors and learn numpy.

Then it turned into an experiment to use OpenGL in C.

Then it was a 3D scanline renderer in C++.

<b>2019:</b>

I had a dream of controlling CNC machines. 

It was almost a GCODE parser (and may be one someday)

(I took a long break from 2020-2025 for a major life reset)

<b>2025:</b>

It was a parallel port testing tool. 

That turned into a way to control 3 stepper motors in 3D space.

<b>2026 and beyond:</b> 

It is all of these things (except the renderer, I ripped that out.)

It is a pile of experiments that will control a CNC machine, or 3D printer, or an SMT pick and place. 

It is general purpose interface from graphicsd on a screen to the physical world.
